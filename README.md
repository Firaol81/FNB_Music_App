# 🎧 FNB Music App

This is my full-stack music platform where users can upload songs, play music, sign in with Firebase, and follow each other. It’s fully working **when run locally**, with clean frontend and backend code.

> ⚠️ **Live Demo Notice:**  
> Some features like login and uploading won’t work online because they depend on the backend. But everything works perfectly when you run it on your computer.
